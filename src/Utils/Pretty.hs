-- | This module defines the tools required to correctly define a pretty
-- printer that can de-parenthesize expressions appropriately. Instead of
-- using something like a fixity level, instead we can represent the problem
-- as determining where to de-parenthesize an expression. For example, if
-- function application is represented as adjacency, as in Haskell, then we
-- can deparenthesize @(M N)@ in the function position of application, i.e.
-- @(M N) P@ can become @M N P@, but not in the argument position, i.e.
-- @M (N P)@ cannot become @M N P@ but instead must remain parenthesized.

class Parens a where
  
  -- | @Loc a@ is the type of names for the recursive locations in @a@.
  type Loc a
  
  -- | 'parenLoc' maps each @a@ to a list of locations that permit it to
  -- be pretty printed without enclosing parentheses.
  parenLoc :: a -> [Loc a]
  
  -- | 'parenRec' pretty prints its argument without enclosing parentheses.
  parenRec :: a -> String


type Pretty a = (Parens a, Eq (Loc a))


-- | The 'parenthesize' function pretty prints its argument, inserting parens
-- appropriately, based on the location of the argument in the overall pretty
-- printing context, given by the argument @l@. When @l = Nothing@, this
-- indicates that the term is the root term, and isn't inside a recursive
-- location, therefore requiring no parentheses.
