# SimpleFP-v2

A re-do of the SimpleFP repo using de Bruijn index ABTs instead of HOAS.

Each file is also now heavily documented in a literate style, and where applicable, there are formal type theoretic specs for the implemented functionality. The specs are more-or-less the real ones, in that they're real enough to make it clear what's going on, without also writing down every little detail.
